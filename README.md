=============

HTML/CSS/JS for my personal (website)[http://www.dangerlibrary.com].

I built this website from scratch, and it's going to evolve over time as I get better at this.  

In the past, I've used web frameworks like express and django. I've set up wordpress sites for myself and for friends, and I've used or modified existing website templates to handle the design. I've used templating tools like jinja2 and jade, and I've used CSS markup tools like stylus. 

When I started this project, I always felt far away from the pages being generated. I selected some options from a GUI menu or wrote some markup in something that was definitely not html, css, or javascript. I pushed that through a program and then HTML, CSS, and javascript appeared. There was some magic happening, and I didn't feel comfortable telling people I knew what I was doing on the web when I didn't understand what was going on on my own websites. I knew how to set up apache or nginx or varnish - I understood which config files controlled my servers and proxies, and if something went wrong I always knew how to fix it, or at least where to start looking. But if a _div_ was misbehaving when a window was resized, I was clueless. I didn't like that feeling. 

It took me a day to wrestle the divs into behaving properly at any size, and to design and code up the structure of the site. Unfortunately I didn't have git set up yet, so there is no record of the early process. At this point I'm filling in the text of the site, and the next step will be to build out the blog. I'll be using a static site model for the blog in order to keep things simple and stick to the spirit of the project. 

Soon, I expect maintaining individual html files will become the pain point for me that has inspired others to turn to templating engines and web frameworks. At that point I will happily leap back into bed with express and jade and stylus, but not before I have a proper understanding of what I'm doing. I want a clear understanding of what I'm getting, and whether additional abstraction is worth the price of additional maintenance.
